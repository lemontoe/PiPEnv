## How to use PiPEnv

**Should be straight forward enough. Even a monkey could figure it out.**
1. Open PiPEnv.bat
2. Provide your installed python path
3. Magic

## Why does PiPEnv even exist?

Some people don't see that little checkbox when installing python that says "Add Python to PATH". Then they cant use pip to install packages, so they go complain to google about python not working because the youtube tutorial they followed was garbage when it probably was.
All this script does is add the path you give it to the user environment variables.

**Can't you just go add it to path by modifying your python install?**
Yeah.. but wheres the fun in that?
